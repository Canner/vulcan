# Pagination
## Why use pagination?

In some cases, we execute SQL queries to list all entities, which may result in a large amount of data. Instead of sending all the data to our clients, we can paginate the results and send only the necessary portion. This approach is a common design in modern API servers.

## Implement Manually

You can implement your own pagination strategies by modifying your SQL queries. For example, you can use parameters to implement a simple offset-based pagination:

```sql
SELECT * FROM users
-- highlight-next-line
LIMIT {{ context.params.limit }}
-- highlight-next-line
OFFSET {{ context.params.offset }}
```

## Automated Pagination
VulcanSQL provides several built-in pagination strategies. You can easily use them by configuring the settings in the `vulcan.yaml`, without the need to modify your SQL template.

For more information about each pagination mode, please refer to the corresponding documentation pages.

| Mode                          | Description                                            |
| ----------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| offset | Offset-based pagination e.g. `/path?offset=10&limit=100` |
| cursor                        | TBD                                                    |
| keyset                        | TBD                                                    |
