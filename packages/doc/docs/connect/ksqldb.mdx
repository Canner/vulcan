# KsqlDB

## Installation

1. Install the package:

   **If you are developing with binary, the package is already bundled in the binary. You can skip this step.**

   ```bash
   npm i @vulcan-sql/extension-driver-ksqldb
   ```

2. Update your `vulcan.yaml` file to enable the extension:

   ```yaml
   extensions:
     ...
     // highlight-next-line
     ksqldb: '@vulcan-sql/extension-driver-ksqldb' # Add this line
   ```

3. Create a new profile in your `profiles.yaml` file or in the designated profile paths. For example:

   ```yaml
   - name: ksql # profile name
     type: ksqldb
     connection:
       host: www.example.com:8088
       username: <username>
       password: <password>
     allow: '*'
   ```
