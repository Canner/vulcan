## How to use
Setting up a data warehouse connector is easy, you can follow the steps below to set up a connector.

1. Once you install the connector package, update the `extensions` section in `vulcan.yaml` to include the connector package. For example:
    ```yaml
   extensions:
     ...
     // highlight-next-line
     pg: '@vulcan-sql/extension-driver-pg' # Add this line
   ```

2. Create a new profile in `profiles.yaml` or in your profile files.

   ```yaml
   - name: pg # profile name
     type: pg
     connection:
       host: example.com
       port: 5432
       user: postgres
       password: some-secret
       database: postgres
   ```

3. Specify the profile name in the configuration file of APIs.

   ```yaml
   profiles:
   // highlight-next-line
    - pg # profile name
   ```

  Then, you can query the data warehouse in your APIs.
