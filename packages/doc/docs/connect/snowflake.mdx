# Snowflake
## Installation

1. Install package

  **If you are developing with binary, the package is already bundled in the binary. You can skip this step.**

   ```bash
   npm i @vulcan-sql/extension-driver-snowflake
   ```

2. Update `vulcan.yaml`, and enable the extension.

   ```yaml
   extensions:
     ...
     // highlight-next-line
     snow: '@vulcan-sql/extension-driver-snowflake' # Add this line
   ```

3. Create a new profile in `profiles.yaml` or in your profile files. For example:

   ```yaml
   - name: snow # profile name
     type: snowflake
     connection:
       account: 'xy123456.ap-northeast-1.aws'
       username: xxxx
       password: xxxx
       warehouse: test
       min: 0
       max: 3
     allow: '*'
   ```
