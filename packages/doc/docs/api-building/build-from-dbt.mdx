# Build from DBT

[DBT](https://www.getdbt.com/) is a powerful tool to transform your data, and Vulcan supports queries from DBT [models](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/building-a-dbt-project/building-models) directly. If you used DBT to create some models, you can make API for them instantly.

## Installation

We need to install an additional package to integrate with DBT:

1.  Install package.

    ```bash
    npm i @vulcan-sql/extension-dbt
    ```

2.  Setup `vulcan.yaml`

    ```yaml
    extensions:
      dbt: '@vulcan-sql/extension-dbt' # add this line
    dbt:
      modelFiles:
        - ./target/manifest.json # config the path to manifest.json
    ```

    :::info

    [Manifest](https://docs.getdbt.com/reference/artifacts/manifest-json) is an artifact which built from DBT cli, it should locate at “./target/manifest.json”
    :::

    :::info

    We are not able to share profiles with DBT yet, you need to config profiles for both Vulcan and DBT separately**.**

## Using models in Vulcan

Using models of DBT is extremely easy, just use the following syntax for the table name.

```sql
{% dbt "model.<project-name>.<model-name>" %}
```

For example, to select all from model `my_first_dbt_model` in the project `demo`:

```sql
select * from {% dbt "model.demo.my_first_dbt_model" %}
```
