# Data Source Profile

When sending an API request to query the data through SQL file logistic, also should check the data source ( e.g: Database, Warehouse ) has connected, so VulcanSQL needs you to define the Data Source Profile.

# Profile Structure

The profile could define in two ways:

## Define profile in independent YAML files

You could create independent YAML files to define data sources and set the filePath in the `profiles` options of the project config:

```yaml
# pg-profile.yaml
- name: pg
  type: postgres
  allow: '*'
  connection:
    host: example.com
    user: vulcan
    password: secret
    database: vulcan
    port: 5432

------------------------------------
# duck-profile.yaml
name: duck
type: duckdb
connection:
   persistent-path: ./test-data/moma.db
   log-queries: true
   log-parameters: true
allow: '*'

-------------------------
# vulcan.yaml (project config)
extensions:
  postgres: '@vulcan-sql/extension-driver-duckdb'
  duckdb: '@vulcan-sql/extension-driver-duckdb'

profiles:
  - ./pg-profile.yaml
  - ./duck-profile.yaml
```

You should make sure you have installed the data source driver package and declared the module name under the `extensions` of the project config.

## Define profile in the project config

Or you could define the data source profile under `profiles` options of the project config :

```yaml
# vulcan.yaml (project config)
extensions:
  duckdb: '@vulcan-sql/extension-driver-duckdb'
  postgres: '@vulcan-sql/extension-driver-duckdb'

profiles:
  - name: duck
    type: duckdb
    connection:
      persistent-path: ./test-data/moma.db
      log-queries: true
      log-parameters: true
    allow: '*'
  - name: pg
    type: postgres
    allow: '*'
    connection:
      host: example.com
      user: vulcan
      password: secret
      database: vulcan
      port: 5432
```

## Profile fields

In. this Profile, we should give these fields:

- `name` - The `name` is the data source name for recognizing so that [Data API Schema](./data-api-schema) could set the name to know where the data source the API request queries the result from. Like above `duckdb-porfile.yaml` example, the name is `duck`, so you could set the `duck` in `profiles` / `profile` in the API Schema to specify what data source the query is from.
- `type` - It's a data source type, each data source type uses the `module-name` under the `extensions` config to be the `type` for recognizing, the above sample you could see.
- `connection` - The needed information to make the connection built, you should check what the connection fields need in each external extension of the data, e.g: [@vulcan-sql/extension-driver-pg](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@vulcan-sql/extension-driver-pg) npm.
- `allow` - The `allow` field could make our Data API could query the data result from different data sources according to whether the user has permission or not. The [Data API Schema](./data-api-schema) `profiles` / `profile` fields have shown some examples. For the `allow` configuration rule, you could see the [Authorization](../access-control/authorization) for introducing detail.
