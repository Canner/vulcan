# Middleware Rate-limit

This module is based on [`koa2-ratelimit`](https://github.com/ysocorp/koa2-ratelimit) and it has reasonable default settings, but you can still use project config (default is `vulcan.yaml`) to change some settings to suit your own needs.

like so:

```yaml
rate-limit:
  enabled: true
  options:
    interval:
      min: 1
    max: 10000
```

### setting

`enabled`

- `default: true`
- `typt: boolean`
- Whether to enable the `cors` service, you can set it to `false` to stop the `cors` service.
