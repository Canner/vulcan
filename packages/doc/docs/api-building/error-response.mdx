# Error Response

Like most programming languages, VulcanSQL SQL Template supports throwing errors. In your SQL templates, you can use `{% error "ERROR_CODE" %}` to define an exception. When an attempt is made to execute it, it causes an error. VulcanSQL stops to execute anything when an error is detected, and itâ€™ll respond error code to the clients instead of returning query results.

For example, you can do a sample check before executing the main query:

```sql
{% req user %}
SELECT COUNT(*) AS count FROM customers WHERE name = {{ context.params.name }}
{% endreq %}

{% if user.value()[0].count == 0 %}
  {% error "CUSTOMER_NOT_FOUND" %}
{% endif %}

SELECT * FROM customers
WHERE name = {{ context.params.name }}
LIMIT 1
```

Clients who send API requests with an invalid name will get 400 error with error code `CUSTOMER_NOT_FOUND` instead of an empty array now.
