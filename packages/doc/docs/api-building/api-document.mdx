# API Document

Vulcan builds and serves the API documentation automatically, all you have to do is to choose the desired document [format](./configuration#document-generator-options).

After Vulcan server starts, visit `<vulcan-endpoint>/doc` to view the document. You can also download the specification from that page.

## Make your document better

Although we'll generate all the required fields of API specification for you, you can make your document better by adding more detailed API descriptions:

### Set sampler

Vulcan has the ability to “guess” the response format by sending a sample query to your warehouse. To enable this feature, you need to set the [sample](./configuration/data-api-schema#sample-fields) property of each API schema.

For example:

```yaml
urlPath: /artist/:id
request:
  - fieldName: id
    fieldIn: path
    description: constituent id
    validators:
      - required
sample:
  parameters:
    id: '1'
  profile: duck
profiles:
  - duck
```

This field has two properties:

| Property name | Required | Description                                              |
| ------------- | -------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| parameters    | N        | The parameters we should use to send sampling queries.   |
| profile       | Y        | The profile name we should use to send sampling queries. |

### Add validators for the requesters

Adding more validators and setting the proper arguments can let your API more stable, and we can also tell users more about your API.

```yaml
fieldName: age
fieldIn: query
type: number
validators:
  - required
  - name: integer
    args:
      min: 18
```

![api request with constraint age > 18](./img/api-req-constraint.png)

### Add descriptions about the requests and the responses

You can add descriptions for both requests and responses:

```yaml
request:
  - fieldName: age
    fieldIn: query
    type: number
    description: Filter the age of artists
    validators:
      - required
      - name: integer
        args:
          min: 18
response:
  - name: ArtistBio
    description: The url to artist's bio
    required: true
```

You can list the response properties partially, we'll merge the result from [Sampler](./api-document#set-sampler)
