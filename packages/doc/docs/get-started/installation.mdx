# Installation

To begin using VulcanSQL, you first need to install the VulcanSQL CLI. The VulcanSQL CLI is a command-line tool that assists in initializing a VulcanSQL project, building your data API server, and starting the server.

## Install From Binary
We provide pre-built binaries for Linux, macOS, and Windows. The binary includes all dependencies, so you don't need to install any additional dependencies.
