# ClickHouse

Connect to your ClickHouse servers using the official [Node.js Driver](https://clickhouse.com/docs/en/integrations/language-clients/nodejs).

## Installation

1. Install package

   ```bash
   npm i @vulcan-sql/extension-driver-clickhouse
   ```

   :::info
   If you run VulcanSQL with Docker, you should use the command `vulcan-install @vulcan-sql/extension-driver-clickhouse` instead.

   :::

2. Update `vulcan.yaml`, and enable the extension.

   ```yaml
   extensions:
     ...
     // highlight-next-line
     ch: '@vulcan-sql/extension-driver-clickhouse' # Add this line
   ```

3. Create a new profile in `profiles.yaml` or in your profile files. For example:

   ```yaml
   - name: ch # profile name
     type: clickhouse
     connection:
       host: www.example.com:8123
       request_timeout: 60000
       compression:
         request: true
       max_open_connections: 10
       username: user
       password: pass
       database: hello-clickhouse
     allow: '*'
   ```

The `log` option is not included above because it requires defining a Logger class and assigning it. Therefore, it cannot be set through `profiles.yaml`.

## Note

ClickHouse supports parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection using prepared statements. Named placeholders are defined using the `{name:type}` syntax. For more information, refer to the [Query with Parameters](https://clickhouse.com/docs/en/integrations/language-clients/nodejs#queries-with-parameters) section in the ClickHouse documentation.

However, the VulcanSQL API supports JSON format for API query parameters and does not support the full range of types available in ClickHouse. VulcanSQL only supports the conversion of the following types:

- `boolean` to ClickHouse type `Boolean`
- `number` to ClickHouse types `Int` or `Float`
- `string` to ClickHouse type `String`

Therefore, if you need to query data with special types in ClickHouse, such as `Array(Unit8)`, `Record<K, V>`, `Date`, `DateTime`, and so on, you can use ClickHouse [Regular Functions](https://clickhouse.com/docs/en/sql-reference/functions) or [Type Conversion Functions](https://clickhouse.com/docs/en/sql-reference/functions/type-conversion-functions) to handle them.

Example:

```sql
-- If the `val` from the API query parameter is '1990-11-01' and the `born_date` column is of type `Date32`,
-- you can use the toDate function to convert the value. See https://clickhouse.com/docs/en/sql-reference/functions/type-conversion-functions#todate
SELECT * FROM users WHERE born_date = toDate({val:String});
```

## ⚠️ Caution

The ClickHouse driver currently does not support caching datasets. If you use the ClickHouse driver with caching dataset features, it will result in failure.

## Testing

To run tests for the `extension-driver-clickhouse` module, use the following command:

```bash
nx test extension-driver-clickhouse
```
