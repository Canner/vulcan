# Extensions

Extensions could make users to create implementing different extension function for enhancing VulcanSQL or satisfy users particular use cases.

We distinguish between **built-in extensions** and **external extensions** for different purpose.

The built-in extensions is VulcanSQL built-in function including `profiles`, `rate-limit`, `enforce-https`, `response-format`, and `auth`, please see the [configuration](./api-building/configuration) to know how to use it.

The external extensions used to make users create they needed function to solve their requirement from particular system architecture environment or satisfy use cases.

For example, some enterprises may use AWS Redshift or Azure Synapse be data source to save data, then you could use [DataSource](./extensions/vulcan-sql-core/data-source) extension to implement Redshift or Synapse connector to query data.

# All Type of Extensions

VulcanSQL provide 17 categories of extension to make users implement customized extension.

You could see the each introduction in the [@vulcan-sql/core](./extensions/vulcan-sql-core), [@vulcan-sql/build](./extensions/vulcan-sql-build), [@vulcan-sql/serve](./extensions/vulcan-sql-serve) pages separately.
