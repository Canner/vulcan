The built-in extensions is VulcanSQL built-in function including `profiles`, `rate-limit`, `enforce-https`, `response-format`, and `auth` which mentioned in [configuration](./api-building/configuration).

The external extensions used to make users create they needed function to solve their requirement from particular system architecture environment or satisfy use cases.
