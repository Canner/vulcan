The built-in extensions is VulcanSQL built-in function including `profiles`, `rate-limit`, `enforce-https`, `response-format`, and `auth` which mentioned in [configuration](./api-building/configuration).

The external extensions used to make users create they needed function to solve their requirement from particular system architecture environment or satisfy use cases.

For example, some enterprises may use AWS Redshift or Azure Synapse be data source to save data, then you could use [DataSource](./extensions/vulcan-sql-core/data-source) extension to implement Redshift or Synapse connector to query data.
