# FilterBuilder

FilterBuilder extension works together with [FilterRunnger](./filter-runner), in most of time, it does nothing but only claims the filter name.

## What's filters

A filter is used to transform variables, e.g. `upper` filter can convert string to upper case.

```sql
SELECT * FROM users WHERE name = {{ context.params.name | upper }}
```

You can use FilterBuilder to add custom filters and control the transform logic.

## How FilterBuilder works

FilterBuilder extensions have no function to implement, the only things we need to do is claiming the name of the filter.

## Example

:::info
You can check the [demo repository](https://github.com/Canner/vulcan-sql-extension-demo/blob/main/extensions/filter-runner-and-builder/src/prefixFilterBuilder.ts) for the full code.

:::

```ts
import { FilterBuilder } from '@vulcan-sql/core';

export class PrefixFilterBuilder extends FilterBuilder {
  public filterName = 'prefix';
}
```
