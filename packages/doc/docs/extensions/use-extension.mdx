# Use Extensions

Besides built-in extensions, you could also use the published external extensions which built by VulcanSQL team or other contributor.

## Install extension npm package

VulcanSQL provides some external extension package for you could use it optionally, please see the [@vulcan-sql/](https://www.npmjs.com/search?q=%40vulcan-sql) prefix npm packages beside `@vulcan-sql/core`, `@vulcan-sql/build` and `@vulcan-sql/serve`.

## Declare used extensions

After you installed package, please declare which extension package you used under the `extensions` key in the `vulcan.yaml`.

```yaml
# Declare you would like to used-external module and give a module name
extensions:
  extension-name1: @vulcan-sql/ext-xxx
  extension-name2: contributor-ext
```

The `extensions` could let you decide what external extensions you would like to use in the VulcanSQL.

You should declare a extension name and specify external extension package name you installed under the `extensions`. For example the `extension-name1` is the extension name and specify to `@vulcan-sql/ext-xxx` package.

## Set-up extension options

After you define the extension name, use the set the options under extension name:

```bash

extension-name1:
  ... # The config options of the extension-name1

extension-name2:
  ... # The config options of extension-name2

# The config options of core feature and built-in extension
...
```

Here is an specific example, you could see the `@vulcan-sql/extension-dbt` it looks like the below:

```yaml
extensions:
  dbt: '@vulcan-sql/extension-dbt'

dbt:
  modelFiles: path/to/folder
```

## ⚠️ Not all extensions have options

Some extension options maybe rely on internal or built-extensions config options and set options under internal or built-extensions config options. We should check each document of the external extensions module.

For example, if you would like to use `@vulcan-sql/extension-driver-duckdb` it looks like the below:

```yaml
extensions:
  duckdb: '@vulcan-sql/extension-driver-duckdb'
```

But the `duckdb` is an data source driver, so if you would like to make your Data API `/orders` could query orders from `duckdb` driver, you should define the `duckdb` data source driver in **data source profile** like below:

```yaml
# duckdb-profile.yaml
name: duck
type: duckdb
connection:
  persistent-path: ./test-data/moma.db
  log-queries: true
  log-parameters: true
allow: '*'
```

Or define it directly under the `profiles` config options of built-in extensions with `extensions` options in the project config:

```yaml
# vulcan.yaml

# other config options core feature
---
extensions:
  duckdb: '@vulcan-sql/extension-driver-duckdb'

profiles:
  - name: duck
    type: duckdb
    connection:
      persistent-path: ./test-data/moma.db
      log-queries: true
      log-parameters: true
    allow: '*'

---
# other config options built-in extensions
```
