# Test Extension

After finishing your developed extension, you may would like to test your extension is workable and debug faults.

In this time you could do it by two ways:

## Local Testing

The local testing means you use the extension in the VulcanSQL locally.

You could use [npm link](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v8/commands/npm-link) to link extension package locally or install local extension package by `npm i <extension-package-folder>`, you could see [Use your customized extensions
](./make-extension).

After you installed local extension package, set the extension configuration in `vulcan.yaml`, same like our other extensions:

```yaml
extensions:
  <extension-name>: <your-linked-extension-package-name>

<extension-name>:
  # your extension configuration
  # ...
```

Finally, test yor extension by `vulcan start` command directly to test it.

:::info
We suggest to do the local test at least for ensuring your extension is workable.

## Unit Testing

Second way, you could write **test case** to do [unit testing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unit_testing) for your extension.

### Create Test Folder

Please create test folder `test/` and put a test file named `[your-extension-name].spec.ts` in `test/` folder, like below:

```bash
 - your-extension-folder
 |
 | -- src/
 |  |
 |  | -- lib/
 |     |
 |     | -- your-extension.ts
 |
 | -- test/
    |
    | -- your-extension.spec.ts # your extension unit test file

```

:::tip
Refer to source code structure of "@vulcan-sql/extension-xxx" extensions be samples, e.g: [@vulcan-sql/extension-dbt](https://github.com/Canner/vulcan-sql/tree/develop/packages/extension-dbt), [@vulcan-sql/extension-driver-pg](https://github.com/Canner/vulcan-sql/tree/develop/packages/extension-driver-pg).
:::

Please installed NodeJS (â‰¥ 16), and installed test framework to write unit test, e.g; [Jest](https://jestjs.io/docs/getting-started), [Mocha](https://mochajs.org/).

```js
it('your unit test description', async () => {
  ...
});
```

### Test Filter and Tag

When need to write unit test for extensions which related to SQL syntax including:

- Filter: [FilterBuilder](./vulcan-sql-core/filter/filter-builder) and [FilterRunner](./vulcan-sql-core/filter/filter-runner)
- Tag: [TagBuilder](./vulcan-sql-core/tag/tag-builder) and [TagRunner](./vulcan-sql-core/tag/tag-runner)

it not easy to check the extension parsed correctly and ran correct result because it work with VulcanSQL compiler.

Therefore, we prepare the test compiler for making you to test filter and tag extension.

please install `@vulcan-sql/test-utility` package and use the package to test filter and tag extensions.

```bash
npm i --save-dev @vulcan-sql/test-utility
```

Write a unit test by importing `getTestCompiler` function:

```js
const { getTestCompiler } = require('@vulcan-sql/test-utility');
```

Then use the `getTestCompiler` to do the test, by this steps:

1. Set extension configuration into the `getTestCompiler` functions and getting the `compileAndLoad`, `execute` and `getExecutedQueries` functions.
2. Compile your filter or tag extension SQL syntax by `compileAndLoad` function, executing the compiled SQL by `execute` function.
3. Getting result by `getExecutedQueries` function and assert your expected answer.

```js
it('unit test description', async () => {
 const { compileAndLoad, execute, getExecutedQueries } = await getTestCompiler(
    {
      // project configuration
      extensions: { <your-extension-name>: path.join(__dirname, '..', 'src') },
      // extension configuration options
      ...
    }
  );

  // Compile your tag or filter syntax
  await compileAndLoad('your tag or filter extension sql syntax');
  await execute({});

  // Get result to assert
  const queries = await getExecutedQueries();
  ...
});
```
