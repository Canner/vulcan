# Hugging Face

## Installation

1. Install the package:

   **If you are developing with binary, the package is already bundled in the binary. You can skip this step.**

   ```bash
   npm i @vulcan-sql/extension-huggingface
   ```

2. Update your `vulcan.yaml` file to enable the extension:

   ```yaml
   extensions:
     ...
     // highlight-next-line
     hf: '@vulcan-sql/extension-huggingface'

   // highlight-next-line
   hf:
     // highlight-next-line
     # Required: Hugging Face access token, see: https://huggingface.co/docs/hub/security-tokens
     // highlight-next-line
     accessToken: 'your-huggingface-access-token'
   ```

## Using Hugging Face

VulcanSQL support using Hugging Face tasks by [VulcanSQL Filters](https://vulcansql.com/docs/develop/advance#filters) statement.

:::caution
Hugging Face has a [rate limit](https://huggingface.co/docs/api-inference/faq#rate-limits), so it does not allow sending large datasets to the Hugging Face library for processing.

Otherwise, using a different Hugging Face model may yield different results or even result in failure.

### Table Question Answering

The [Table Question Answering](https://huggingface.co/docs/api-inference/detailed_parameters#table-question-answering-task) is one of the Natural Language Processing tasks supported by Hugging Face.

Using the `huggingface_table_question_answering` filter.

Sample 1:

```sql
{% set data = [
  {
    "repository": "vulcan-sql",
    "topic": ["analytics", "data-lake", "data-warehouse", "api-builder"],
    "description":"Create and share Data APIs fast! Data API framework for DuckDB, ClickHouse, Snowflake, BigQuery, PostgreSQL"
  },
  {
    "repository": "accio",
    "topic": ["data-analytics", "data-lake", "data-warehouse", "bussiness-intelligence"],
    "description": "Query Your Data Warehouse Like Exploring One Big View."
  },
  {
    "repository": "hell-word",
    "topic": [],
    "description": "Sample repository for testing"
  }
] %}

-- The source data for "huggingface_table_question_answering" needs to be an array of objects.
SELECT {{ data | huggingface_table_question_answering(query="How many repositories related to data-lake topic?") }}
```

Sample 2:

```sql
{% req products %}
  SELECT * FROM products
{% endreq %}

SELECT {{ products.value() | huggingface_table_question_answering(query="How many products related to 3C type?", model="microsoft/tapex-base-finetuned-wtq", wait_for_model=true, use_cache=true) }}
```

### Arguments

Please check [Table Question Answering](https://huggingface.co/docs/api-inference/detailed_parameters#table-question-answering-task) for further information.

| Name           | Required | Default                         | Description                                                                                                                                               |
| -------------- | -------- | ------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| query          | Y        |                                 | The query in plain text that you want to ask the table.                                                                                                   |
| model          | N        | google/tapas-base-finetuned-wtq | The model id of a pretrained model hosted inside a model repo on huggingface.co. See: https://huggingface.co/models?pipeline_tag=table-question-answering |
| use_cache      | N        | true                            | There is a cache layer on the inference API to speedup requests we have already seen                                                                      |
| wait_for_model | N        | false                           | If the model is not ready, wait for it instead of receiving 503. It limits the number of requests required to get your inference done                     |
