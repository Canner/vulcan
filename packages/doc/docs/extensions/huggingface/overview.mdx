# The Hugging Face Extensions

## Installation

1. Install the package:

   **If you have VulcanSQL installed in the binary version, the package is already bundled in the binary. You can skip this step.**

   ```bash
   npm i @vulcan-sql/extension-huggingface
   ```

2. Update your `vulcan.yaml` file to enable the extension:

   ```yaml
   extensions:
     ...
     // highlight-next-line
     hf: '@vulcan-sql/extension-huggingface'

   // highlight-next-line
   hf:
     // highlight-next-line
     # Required: Hugging Face access token, see: https://huggingface.co/docs/hub/security-tokens
     // highlight-next-line
     accessToken: 'your-huggingface-access-token'
   ```

## Using Hugging Face

VulcanSQL supports using Hugging Face tasks by the [VulcanSQL Filters](../../develop/advanced#filters) statement.

:::caution
Hugging Face has a [rate limit](https://huggingface.co/docs/api-inference/faq#rate-limits), so it does not allow sending large datasets to the Hugging Face library for processing.

Otherwise, using a different Hugging Face model may yield different results or even result in failure.
