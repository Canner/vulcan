# Overview

Extensions is one of VulcanSQL's important features to enable users to create data APIs in a more flexible way!

There are **built-in extensions** and **external extensions** in VulcanSQL.

The built-in extensions include `profiles`, `rate-limit`, `enforce-https`, `response-format`, `auth`, etc., which are mentioned in the section of [API Configuration](../api-plugin/overview).

On the other hand, the external extensions is a mechanism to grant you the power to create your own extensions, or even use others' built ones.
