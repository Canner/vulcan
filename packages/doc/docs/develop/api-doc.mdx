# API Documentation
In this section, we will discuss how VulcanSQL automatically generates API documentation in the Swagger format. This feature enables developers to easily understand and interact with the API endpoints, making it a valuable tool for collaboration and testing.

VulcanSQL automatically generates and serves the API documentation for you. To view the documentation, navigate to `<vulcan-endpoint>/doc` after starting the VulcanSQL server. From this page, you can also download the API specification in the Swagger format.
