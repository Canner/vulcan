# Fly.io

In this step-by-step guide, we'll guide you how to deploy your VulcanSQL project to [Fly.io](https://fly.io/). 
Fly.io is a developer friendly service to deploy your apps. Besides, it has [free allowances](https://fly.io/docs/about/pricing/#em-free-allowances-em), 
which is a great deployment option for side-projects.

## Step 1: Install Fly.io

Please go to [this website](https://fly.io/docs/hands-on/install-flyctl/) for installing `flyctl`, which is a command-line utility that lets you work with Fly.io. 
You should install the version that's appropriate for your operating system.

After successfully installed `flyctl`, you should see the following message if you type `fly` in the terminal:

```
cyyeh@JimmydeMBP vulcan-sql % fly
This is flyctl, the Fly.io command line interface.

Here's a few commands to get you started:
  fly launch      Launch a new application
  fly apps        Create and manage apps
  fly postgres    Create and manage Postgres databases
        fly mysql       Create and manage PlanetScale MySQL databases
  fly redis       Create and manage Upstash Redis databases
  fly machines    Create and manage individual Fly.io machines

If you need help along the way:
  fly help            Display a complete list of commands
  fly help <command>  Display help for a specific command, e.g. 'fly help launch'

Visit https://fly.io/docs for additional documentation & guides
```

## Step 2: Login to Fly.io

**Signup**

If this is your first time setting up Fly.io, please execute the following command in the terminal:

```bash
fly auth signup
```

After successfully sign up in Fly.io, you should see the following message in the terminal:

```
Waiting for session... Done
successfully logged in as xxxxx@xxx
```

For more detailed introduction on how to sign up, you can [read more here](https://fly.io/docs/hands-on/sign-up/).

**Login**

If you already have a Fly.io account, please execute the following command in the terminal:

```bash
fly auth login
```

After successfully login in Fly.io, you should see the following message in the terminal:

```
Waiting for session... Done
successfully logged in as xxxxx@xxx
```

For more detailed introduction on how to sign in, you can [read more here](https://fly.io/docs/hands-on/sign-in/).

## Step 3: Package your VulcanSQL project

In this guide, we'll deploy the Docker version of your VulcanSQL project. So please execute the following command in the terminal:

```bash
vulcan package --output docker
```

After executing the command, you'll see a message shown like below and a new directory `dist` in the project directory.

```bash
2023-08-07 08:47:26.246  INFO  [CORE] Package successfully, you can go to "dist" folder and run "docker build ." to build the image. 
✔ Package successfully.
```

The directory structure of `dist` is as following:

```
dist
├── Dockerfile
├── config.json
├── index.js
├── package.json
└── result.json
```

:::caution
External resources and configurations, such as `profiles.yaml`, are not copied to the `dist` folder. 
You'll need to copy them manually. We strongly recommend using a separate profile instead of the one used for development.

After copying `profiles.yaml` into the `dist` folder, you should also add one line in `Dockerfile` as following:

```shell
.
.
.
FROM node:16-bullseye-slim
WORKDIR /usr/app
COPY --from=build /usr/app /usr/app
COPY config.json .
COPY index.js .
COPY result.json .
# add the line below
COPY profiles.yaml .
ENV NODE_ENV production

CMD [ "node", "index.js" ]
```

**Notes: if you have [multiple profiles](../references/data-source-profile#define-profile-in-independent-yaml-files), you should copy them into the dist folder and add them all in the Dockerfile.**
:::

## Step 4: Setup Fly.io deployment config

Please execute the following command in the terminal in order to generate a Fly.io deployment config `fly.toml`:

```shell
fly launch
```

After executing the command, Fly.io would ask you several questions such as:
1. Chooese an app name
2. Select organization
3. Choose a region for deployment
4. Would you like to set up a Postgresql database now?
5. Would you like to set up an Upstash Redis database now?
6. Would you like to deploy now?

After answering these questions, you will see `fly.toml` in the `dist` folder and the content is similar to this:

```toml
# fly.toml app configuration file generated for xxxxx on 2023-07-13T22:40:54+08:00
#
# See https://fly.io/docs/reference/configuration/ for information about how to use this file.
#

app = "xxxxx"
primary_region = "bos"

[http_service]
  internal_port = 3000
  force_https = true
  auto_stop_machines = false
  auto_start_machines = false
  min_machines_running = 1
  processes = ["app"]
```

:::info
You can make `auto_stop_machines` to be false, so that you don't need to worry if the machine will hibernate if no one accesses it for a while.

## Step 5: Deploy to Fly.io

Finally, you can execute the following command in the terminal to deploy your VulcanSQL project and share it with the world!

```shell
fly deploy
```

After successfully deploying the app, you should see the following message in the terminal:

```shell
Watch your app at https://fly.io/apps/xxxx/monitoring

Visit your newly deployed app at https://xxxxx/
```

:::info
You can read more here regarding to [deployment via Dockerfile](https://fly.io/docs/languages-and-frameworks/dockerfile/).

Congratulations! Now your VulcanSQL app is on the cloud and is ready to be shared to the world!
