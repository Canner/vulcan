# GCP: Cloud Run

In this step-by-step guide, we'll guide you how to deploy your VulcanSQL project to Google Cloud Platform(GCP)
using [Cloud Run](https://cloud.google.com/run). It's a service that we can build and deploy containerized apps
written in any language(including Go, Python, Java, Node.js, .Net, and Ruby) on a fully managed platform.

For more detailed information of the deployment process, you can [read more here](https://cloud.google.com/run/docs/quickstarts/build-and-deploy/deploy-nodejs-service).

## Step 1: Install and setup the Google Cloud CLI

Before you begin to use Cloud Run on GCP, you need to do several things:
1. In the Google Cloud console, on the [project selector page](https://console.cloud.google.com/projectselector2/home/dashboard), select or create a Google Cloud project.
2. [Make sure the billing is enabled for your Google Cloud project.](https://cloud.google.com/billing/docs/how-to/verify-billing-enabled#console)
3. [Install](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/install) the Google Cloud CLI.
4. Initialize the gcloud CLI with the following command:
    ```shell
    gcloud init
    ```
5. You can set the default project for your Cloud Run service with the following command:
    ```shell
    gcloud config set project [PROJECT_ID]
    ```

For more detailed instructions on how to setup the environment, you can [read more here](https://cloud.google.com/run/docs/quickstarts/build-and-deploy/deploy-nodejs-service#before-you-begin).

## Step 2: Package your VulcanSQL project

In this guide, we'll deploy the Docker version of your VulcanSQL project. So please execute the following command in the terminal:

```bash
vulcan package --output docker
```

After executing the command, you'll see a message shown like below and a new directory `dist` in the project directory.

```bash
2023-08-07 08:47:26.246  INFO  [CORE] Package successfully, you can go to "dist" folder and run "docker build ." to build the image. 
✔ Package successfully.
```

The directory structure of `dist` is as following:

```
dist
├── Dockerfile
├── config.json
├── index.js
├── package.json
└── result.json
```

:::caution
External resources and configurations, such as `profiles.yaml`, are not copied to the `dist` folder. 
You'll need to copy them manually. We strongly recommend using a separate profile instead of the one used for development.

## Step 3: Deploy to Cloud Run from source

Now you can deploy you VulcanSQL app to GCP with the following command:

```shell
gloud run deploy [YOUR_CLOUDRUN_SERVICE_NAME] --port=3000 --allow-unauthenticated
```

:::caution
Important: This quickstart assumes that you have owner or editor roles in the project you are using for the quickstart. 
Otherwise, refer to [Cloud Run deployment permissions](https://cloud.google.com/run/docs/reference/iam/roles#additional-configuration), 
[Cloud Build permissions](https://cloud.google.com/build/docs/iam-roles-permissions#predefined_roles), and 
[Artifact Registry permissions](https://cloud.google.com/artifact-registry/docs/access-control#permissions) for the permissions required.
:::

After successfully deploy the app, you'll see a similar message in the terminal:

```
Service [vulcansql-project] revision [vulcansql-project-00001-mud] has been deployed and is serving 100 percent of traffic.
Service URL: https://vulcansql-project-ggcxvljfba-df.a.run.app
```

Congratulations! Now your VulcanSQL app is on the cloud and is ready to be shared to the world!
