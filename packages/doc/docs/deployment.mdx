# Production

Once your development and testing phases are complete, it's time to deploy your code to production servers. VulcanSQL server requires only a few assets to run, and you can generate these assets using the vulcan `package` command.

## Running Production Servers with Node.js

If your production servers have Node.js (version 16 or higher) installed, use the following command to generate resources:

```bash
vulcan package --output node
```

After a successful build, copy the files in the ./dist folder to your production servers. Then run npm install && node index.js to start the server.

:::caution
External resources and configurations, such as profile.yaml, are not copied to the dist folder. You'll need to copy them manually. We strongly recommend using a separate profile instead of the one used for development.

## Running Production Servers with Docker (or other [container runtimes](https://kubernetes.io/docs/setup/production-environment/container-runtimes/))

If you prefer to run your servers using Docker, Kubernetes, or other container platforms, you can build an image for them with the following command:

```bash
vulcan package --output docker
docker build -t <tag> ./dist
```
