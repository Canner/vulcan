It also tells you about your rights in relation to your personal data.

What Is Personal Data And Who Is Responsible For Looking After My Personal Data?
Personal data is any information about an identifiable individual. Canner is responsible for personal data which we collect from you and, along with our distributors, resellers, dealers and other sales channels, we are also responsible for how we handle personal data which we collect from Canner’s sales partners.

How Long Will We Keep Your Personal Data For?
We will only retain your personal data for as long as necessary to fulfil the purposes we collected it for, including for the purposes of satisfying any legal, accounting, or reporting requirements. To determine the appropriate retention period for personal data, we consider the amount, nature, and sensitivity of the personal data, the potential risk of harm from unauthorized use or disclosure of your personal data, the purposes for which we process your personal data and whether we can achieve those purposes through other means, and the applicable legal requirements. In some circumstances you can ask us to delete your data: see the “Your Choices” section below for further information. In some circumstances we may anonymize your personal data (so that it can no longer be associated with you) for research or statistical purposes in which case we may use this information indefinitely without further notice to you.

Surveys and Responsive Requests; Social Media
If you have opted to participate, from time to time, we may request information from users via surveys or similar responsive requests. Participation in these surveys or responsive requests is completely voluntary and the user therefore has a choice whether or not to disclose this information. Information requested may include contact information (such as name, email and shipping address), and demographic information (such as zip code, age level). If you give us personal information about somebody else, such as a spouse or work colleague, we will assume that you have their permission to do so. Survey information may be used to monitor or improve the use and satisfaction of the Sites or our products and Products.

Our Sites may also use social media features, such as the Facebook ‘like’ button. These features may collect your IP address and which page you are visiting and may set a cookie to enable the feature to function properly. You may be given the option to post information about your activities on our Sites to a profile page of yours that is provided by a third party social media network in order to share with others within your network. Social media features are either hosted by a third party or hosted directly on our Sites. Your interactions with these features are governed by the privacy policy of the company providing the relevant social media features.

We may provide bulletin boards, blogs, or chat rooms on our Sites. Any personal information you choose to submit in such a forum may be read, collected, or used by others who visit these forums, and may be used to send you unsolicited messages.

Canner will not disclose your personal information or information regarding your use of our Sites or Products to any third party without your prior consent except to affiliates and service providers solely for the purpose of providing the Products to you or in connection with the transfer of our business or assets to which the information relates (collectively “Third Parties”). We will require all Third Parties to abide by confidentiality obligations in order to protect your information. In addition, we require that Third Parties provide robust protection of your information no less protective than as set out in this Policy. Moreover, we may disclose your information as lawfully requested by governmental, judicial or public authorities, including to meet national security or law enforcement requirements, to comply with applicable laws and regulations, and pursuant to legal and equitable actions concerning the Products, this Policy or the Terms of Use. Your information will not be used by us or shared with any Third Parties for advertising purposes.

If we are involved in a merger, acquisition or asset sale, such information may be shared with the acquiring entity or successor-in-interest, but we will continue to ensure the confidentiality of any personal data pursuant to the terms of this Policy.

International Transfers
We are an entity which is based in the United States of America, and we may utilize service providers that are based outside of the European Economic Area (EEA).

We will only transfer your personal data to countries that have been deemed to provide an adequate level of protection for personal data by the European Commission.
Where we use certain service providers, we may use specific contracts approved by the European Commission which give personal data the same protection it has in Europe. Please contact us at privacy@cannerdata.com if you want further information on the specific mechanism used by us when transferring your personal data out of the EEA.

We implement appropriate measures and processes, such as using encryption when transmitting certain sensitive information, to help us to keep your information secure and to maintain its quality. We regularly review our security and related policies to adapt the technology as new threats evolve and monitor our systems to help ensure the highest level of availability. If you have any questions about the security of our Sites or Products, you can contact us at privacy@cannerdata.com.

We restrict access to your information in our possession to those of our employees who need access to perform their job functions, such as our customer service personnel and technical staff, but only if they are required to comply with this Policy.

You may access, edit or delete your personal information by contacting Canner by mail or email as per the For More Information section below. In making modifications to your personal information in Canner’s possession, you must provide only truthful, complete, and accurate information. Canner will endeavor to respond in a timely manner to all reasonable written or email requests to view, modify, or delete your personal information, but in no event will our initial response take longer than thirty (30) days.

Your Rights
In addition to those rights specified under “Your Choices” above, under certain circumstances, you have rights under data protection laws in relation to your personal data. We have explained your rights below; if you wish to exercise any of your rights, please contact us at privacy@cannerdata.com. You have the right to:

Request access to your personal data (commonly known as a “data subject access request”). This enables you to receive a copy of the personal data we hold about you and to check that we are lawfully processing it.
Request correction of the personal data that we hold about you. This enables you to have any incomplete or inaccurate data we hold about you corrected, though we may need to verify the accuracy of the new data you provide to us.
Request erasure of your personal data. This enables you to ask us to delete or remove personal data where there is no good reason for us continuing to process it. You also have the right to ask us to delete or remove your personal data where you have successfully exercised your right to object to processing (see below), where we may have processed your information unlawfully or where we are required to erase your personal data to comply with local law. Note, however, that we may not always be able to comply with your request of erasure for specific legal reasons which will be notified to you, if applicable, at the time of your request.
Object to processing of your personal data where we are relying on a legitimate interest (or those of a third party) and there is something about your particular situation which makes you want to object to processing on this ground as you feel it impacts on your fundamental rights and freedoms. You also have the right to object where we are processing your personal data for direct marketing purposes. In some cases, we may demonstrate that we have compelling legitimate grounds to process your information which override your rights and freedoms.
Request restriction of processing of your personal data. This enables you to ask us to suspend the processing of your personal data in the following scenarios: (a) if you want us to establish the data’s accuracy; (b) where our use of the data is unlawful but you do not want us to erase it; (c) where you need us to hold the data even if we no longer require it as you need it to establish, exercise or defend legal claims; or (d) you have objected to our use of your data but we need to verify whether we have overriding legitimate grounds to use it.
Request the transfer of your personal data to you or to a third party. We will provide to you, or a third party you have chosen, your personal data in a structured, commonly used, machine-readable format. Note that this right only applies to automated information which you initially provided consent for us to use or where we used the information to perform a contract with you.
Withdraw consent at any time where we are relying on consent to process your personal data. However, this will not affect the lawfulness of any processing carried out before you withdraw your consent. If you do not want to receive promotional or other e-mail from us, you can remove yourself from our mailing lists.
No Fee Usually Required
You will not have to pay a fee to access your personal data (or to exercise any of the other rights). However, we may charge a reasonable fee if your request is clearly unfounded, repetitive or excessive. Alternatively, we may refuse to comply with your request in these circumstances.

Your Right To Make A Complaint And How To Contact Us
Your privacy is very important to us. You have the right to make a complaint at any time to the supervisory authority for data protection issues in your country. We would, however, appreciate the chance to deal with your concerns so if you have any questions or concerns regarding our privacy policies please contact us at privacy@cannerdata.com.

We do not allow such children to register as users and will not knowingly collect or solicit personal data from anyone under the age of 13.
