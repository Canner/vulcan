# API Schema

API Schema is a definition file for creating each Data API endpoint. When using VulcanSQL, you not only write SQL Query files to get results from the data source, but also need to write the API Schema, or no API created.

## API Schema Structure

Below is a API schema structure example, the API schema uses YAML format to define it:

```yaml
urlPath: /users/:id
request:
  - fieldName: id
    fieldIn: path
    description: user id
    validators:
      - uuid
      - required
profiles:
  - pg # replace this with your profile name
```

VulcanSQL will read the API Schema and know what the SQL files mapping it, then auto-generated APIs that map to the user-written SQL files.

Below is the introduction of each field in the structure.

## API Schema Fields

### `urlPath` Field

This is the Data API endpoint URL path. you could add the path parameter hereby `:[param-name]`, format, but when you add the path parameter, the `feildName` should also have the path parameter, and `fieldIn` should be `path`, if you forgot, VulcanSQL will auto-generated it to make it work.

```yaml
urlPath: /users/:id
request:
  - fieldName: id
    fieldIn: path
    ....
```

After API is generated, VulcanSQL will add a prefix `/api` to distinguish Data API endpoints and other Non-Data API endpoints. For the above sample, the request url eventually should be `/api/users/:id`.

If you don't set urlPath, VulcanSQL uses your API Schema filename as the url, e.g. API schema filename is `user.yaml`, then the urlPath will be `/user`.

### `templateSource` Field

The`templateSource` field could let VulcanSQL know what the SQL file this API will like to map for querying it and response data. It should be SQL filename ( not need file extension ).

```yaml
- sqls
  - user.yaml
  - user.sql

# user.yaml
urlPath: /users/:id
templateSource: user
...
```

### `request` Fields

The `request` define what the request parameters would like to send with the API request, if you would like to have parameters to send the request, you should define the parameter with at least `fieldName`, `fieldIn` two fields.

- `fieldName` - The field name of the parameter of the API request, but the parameter field is optional, so you could send the request with the parameter optional. However, if your parameter is a path parameter e.g: `/users/:id`, then VulcanSQL will make the path parameter **required**.
- `fieldIn` - Where the parameter field is put in with the API request. It could be `path`, `query`, and `header`. If the `fieldIn` is the `path`, then you should also define the path parameter in `urlPath` . below is the sample:

  ```yaml
  urlPath: users
  request:
    - fieldName: gender
      fieldIn: query
      ...
    - fieldName: age
      fieldIn: query
  ```

  The request could be below 4 cases:

  ```bash
  /api/users
  /api/users?gender=male
  /api/users?age=18
  /api/users?gender=male&age=18

  ```

- `type` - The `type` could let VulcanSQL know the data is what type for handing it. The type could be `string`, `number`, and `boolean`.
  If not set the field, the default is `string` type. But don't worry, in most time, the driver is smart enough to handle parameter types, so it might take more effect on validators.
- `description` - The `description` field is an optional value too, but if you add the `description`, then it could make the API document could display the description to make the users know what the request field is.
- `validators` - The `validators` field is an array type to make the request parameter field have some validator to check the value format. E.g If your parameter field should be required, then set the `requried` in validators could make VulcanSQL check the parameter must be required. VulcanSQL provides some built-in validators for you, you could see the [API Validation](../develop/validator) to know the detail.

### `sample` fields

The `sample` fields are optional fields, if you don't set them, then the API document will show the response fields in the API endpoint introduction. VulcanSQL will use `sample` fields to send a query for sampling and get the result column with the field type for generating the information in the API documentation.

If you would like to set it, you should provide these fields:

- `parameters` - The `parameters` could let you set the sampling data for the SQL query needed, for example, if your API needs to send the request with `gender` and `age`, then you should send the field in the `sample` fields:

- `profiles`: The `profiles` indicate the data source you would like to use for querying the sample data result.

```yaml
urlPath: users/:id
request:
  - fieldName: id
    fieldIn: path
    type: string
    ...
sample:
  profile: pg
  parameters:
    id: '1234'
profiles:
  - pg
```

:::info
For the more detail of using `sample` field, please see [API Document](../develop/api-doc#setting-sampler).

### `profiles` field / `profile` field

The `profiles` / `profile` indicated which data sources the API will use to query the data result.

The `profiles` field take precedence over the `profile` field when both existed.

When you use the `profile`, it means the API endpoint will query the data from the data source, and each data source could set the [Authorization](../data-privacy/authz) to specify who ( users ) have permission to send the query by the Data API.

```yaml
urlPath: user/:id
request: ...

# only user1, and user2 have the pg permission to send the API for querying.
profile: pg
```

Like the above example, if today user3 would like to query the API, it has no authorization to the get result.

When using the `profiles`, it could support multiple data sources like the below examples:

```yaml
urlPath: user/:id
request: ...

profile:
  # only user1, and user2 have the pg permission to send the API for querying.
  - pg
  # only user1, and user3 have the duckdb permission to send the API for querying.
  - duckdb
```

With the above example, user3 can use only `duckdb` profile to send queries.

This feature could make the user could use the sample SQL query but control the permission to make different use querying the data from different data sources.

:::caution
You should make sure the `pg` and `duckdb` profiles have been properly configured for your project, please check [Data Source Profile](./data-source-profile) for further information.
