# API Schema

The API Schema is a configuration file for each Data API endpoint.

## API Schema Structure

Below is an example of the API schema structure, and the API schema uses the YAML format:

```yaml
urlPath: /users/:id
request:
  - fieldName: id
    fieldIn: path
    description: user id
    validators:
      - uuid
      - required
profiles:
  - pg # replace this with your profile name
```

Here is the introduction of each field in the API Schema.

## API Schema Fields

### `urlPath` Field

This is the Data API endpoint URL path. You could add the path parameter here using the `:[param-name]` format.
If you forgot to add the `fieldName` and `filedIn` only if it's not `header`, VulcanSQL will auto generate it to make it work.

```yaml
urlPath: /users/:id
request:
  - fieldName: id
    fieldIn: path
    ....
```

After API is generated, VulcanSQL will add a prefix `/api` to distinguish Data API endpoints and other Non-Data API endpoints. For the above sample, the request url eventually should be `/api/users/:id`.

If you don't set the `urlPath`, VulcanSQL uses your API Schema filepath as the url, e.g. API schema filepath is `new/user.yaml`, then the urlPath will be `/new/user`.

### `templateSource` Field

The `templateSource` field is the mapping to the name of the respective SQL file.

```yaml
- sqls
  - user.yaml
  - user.sql

# user.yaml
urlPath: /users/:id
templateSource: user
...
```

### `request` Fields

The `request` fields define what are the request parameters sent with the API request.
If you would like to send a request with a parameter, you should define the parameter with at least `fieldName` and `fieldIn` fields.

- `fieldName` - The field name of the parameter of the API request. If it's a query parameter, it is optional by default. However, if your parameter is a path parameter e.g: `/users/:id`, then VulcanSQL will make the path parameter **required**.
- `fieldIn` - Where is the parameter field put within the API request. It could be `path`, `query`, and `header`. If the `fieldIn` is the `path`, then you should also define the path parameter in `urlPath`. Here is the sample:

  ```yaml
  urlPath: users
  request:
    - fieldName: gender
      fieldIn: query
      ...
    - fieldName: age
      fieldIn: query
  ```

  The requests could be 4 cases shown below:

  ```bash
  /api/users
  /api/users?gender=male
  /api/users?age=18
  /api/users?gender=male&age=18
  ```

- `type` - It means the request parameter data type. It could be `string`, `number`, or `boolean`, and the default is `string` type.
- `description` - It's optional. If you add the `description` text, it'll be shown on the API documentation and the API catalog. It's more user friendly for users.
- `validators` - The `validators` field is an array type. It's used for validating request parameters. 
For example, if your parameter field is required, then the `required` value should be filled in. VulcanSQL also provides some built-in validators for you, 
you could see the [API Validation](../develop/validator) for further details.

### `sample` fields

The `sample` fields are optional fields, if you don't set them, then the API document will show the response fields in the API endpoint introduction. VulcanSQL will use `sample` fields to send a query for sampling and get the result column with the field type for generating the information in the API documentation.

If you would like to set it, you should provide these fields:

- `parameters` - The parameters of API requests for querying sampling data.

- `profile`: The `profile` indicates the data source you would like to use for querying the sample data.

```yaml
urlPath: users/:id
request:
  - fieldName: id
    fieldIn: path
    type: string
    ...
sample:
  profile: pg
  parameters:
    id: '1234'
profiles:
  - pg
```

For further details of using the `sample` field, please check out the section of [API Document](../develop/api-doc#setting-sampler) documentation.

### `profiles` / `profile` field

The `profiles` / `profile` indicate what data sources the APIs use to query the data.

The `profiles` field takes precedence over the `profile` field when both existed.

When you use the `profile`, it means the API endpoint will query the data from the data source. 
You could set the [Authorization](../data-privacy/authz) for each data source to specify who has the permission to query data from APIs.

```yaml
urlPath: user/:id
request: ...

# only user1, and user2 have the pg permission to send the API for querying.
profile: pg
```

Like the above example, if user3 would like to query data from APIs, he doesn't have the permission to the get data.

If you specify the `profiles` field, it could support multiple data sources like the below example:

```yaml
urlPath: user/:id
request: ...

profile:
  # only user1, and user2 have the pg permission to send the API for querying.
  - pg
  # only user1, and user3 have the duckdb permission to send the API for querying.
  - duckdb
```

With the above example, user3 can only use the `duckdb` profile to send API requests.

:::caution
You should make sure the `pg` and `duckdb` profiles have been properly configured for your project, please check out [Data Source Profile](./data-source-profile) for further information.
