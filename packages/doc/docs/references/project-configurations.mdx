# Project Configurations

After creating a VulcanSQL project by `vulcan init`, you will see a file named `vulcan.yaml` under the root of the project directory.
You can see **VulcanSQL's project configurations** like data source, authentication, API Documentation, etc. in the `vulcan.yaml`.

# The project configuration file

Although we said that the `vulcan.yaml` is the main VulcanSQL project configuration file, but it is not mandatory. You could change the project configuration file name whatever you like by passing the option. However, `vulcan.yaml` is the default filename when you use commands like `vulcan build`, `vulcan serve`, or `vulcan start`.

So for example, if you rename the project file name to `hello-world.yaml`, then when you run the above commands, you should add the optional options `-c` or `--config`:

```bash
$ mv vulcan.yaml hello-world.yaml
$ vulcan start -c ./hello-world.yaml  # set the configuation filename to `hello-world.yaml`
```

# The structure of the project configurations

It's the default project configuration settings, when you enter `vulcan init` , you will see some configuration options you have pre-defined, below is a sample of how the file is contructed:

```yaml
# The project name, description version
name: my-first-vulcan-project
description: A starter VulcanSQL project
version: 0.2.0

# The configuration options of core feature
template:
  provider: LocalFile
  folderPath: sqls
  codeLoader: InMemory
artifact:
  provider: LocalFile
  serializer: JSON
  filePath: result.json
schema-parser:
  reader: LocalFile
  folderPath: sqls
document-generator:
  specs:
    - oas3
types:
  - RESTFUL

# The external extension modules you wouldl like to use in your VulcanSQL project
extensions:
  duckdb: '@vulcan-sql/extension-driver-duckdb'

# The configuration options of built-in extensions
profiles:
  - profile.yaml
rate-limit:
  options:
    interval:
      min: 1
    max: 10000
enforce-https:
  enabled: false
auth:
  enabled: false
response-format:
  enabled: true
  options:
    default: json
    formats:
      - json
      - csv
```

You will see a split of four major sections by the above comment, the sections consist of our **project information**, **core feature** configuration options, **built-in extension**, and **external extension** configuration options.

## Project information

In the VulcanSQL project configuration, we will provide a section for you to define the project `name` and give it a `description` for the project's purpose. The `version` will record as of your API version, you should bump this value when your API changes by following [`semver`](https://semver.org/) conventions.

```yaml
name: my-first-vulcan-project
description: A starter VulcanSQL project
version: 0.2.0
```

## Core feature options

VulcanSQL has some configuration options related to our core features, below are the core feature options:

```yaml
template:
  provider: LocalFile
  folderPath: sqls
  codeLoader: InMemory
artifact:
  provider: LocalFile
  serializer: JSON
  filePath: result.json
schema-parser:
  reader: LocalFile
  folderPath: sqls
document-generator:
  specs:
    - oas3
types:
  - RESTFUL
profiles:
  - profile.yaml
```

Actually, the `template`, `artifact`, and `document-generator` options are related to the `vulcan build` and `vulcan serve` command and we called **build phase** and **serving phase**. For the `schema-parser`, `types` and `profiles` related to **serving phase**,

### Build phase and Serve phase

In the **build phase**, VulcanSQL will use the `template` options to find where is the user-written SQL files and compile the SQL files to the artifact compiled files to the `artifact` options defined places.

In the **serving phase**, VulcanSQL will use the `schema-parser` option to find where is the user-written API schema files, then VulcanSQL will check the API protocol user would like to create as the API endpoints, according to the `types` option.

When API is created and users send requests to the API endpoints, VulcanSQL will use `template` and `artifact` options again for translating the SQL files and send to data sources, for the data sources connection information, VulcanSQL rely on `profiles` option to find each data source settings.

### `template` options

- **provider** - The `provider` represents what the provider used to read the SQL files. VulcanSQL uses the `LocalFile` type as a default value, which means the SQL files are put in local places.
- **codeLoader** - The `codeLoader` option tells the compiler what code loader type we keep the data in, and VulcanSQL default use `InMemory` .
- **folderPath** - When the `provider` is `LocalFile`, we need to set the `folderPath` option. The `folderPath` indicates a folder location which used to put your SQL files.

```yaml
template:
  provider: LocalFile
  folderPath: path/to/folder
  codeLoader: InMemory
```

If you put to provide the folder name directly, we will find the folder in the current project.

```yaml
folderPath: sqls # path to ./sqls folder
```

### `artifact` options

- **provider** - Similar to `template` options' `provider`, but it used to save and read the artifact file. The default value is also for `LocalFile`
- **serializer** - Indicate the format which the compiled artifact file serializes it.
- **filePath** - The compiled artifact file kept location.

```yaml
artifact:
  provider: LocalFile
  serializer: JSON
  filePath: path/to/file.json
```

### `schema-parser` options

- **reader** - Similar to `template` options' `provider` The default value is `LocalFile`.
- **folderPath** - When the `provider` is `LocalFile`, we need to set the `folderPath` option. The `folderPath` indicates a folder location which used to put your API schema files.

```yaml
schema-parser:
  reader: LocalFile
  folderPath: sqls # Path to ./sqls folder
```

We suggest you put each API schema file in the same layer as the SQL file and name it as the same SQL file to recognize it easily, otherwise if your API schema does not define some field, VulcanSQL will use the API Schema filename to match the same name SQL file for querying data result:

```yaml
/sqls
  # Query order SQL file and its API schema file
  - orders.sql
  - orders.yaml
  # Query users SQL file and its API schema file
  - ursers.sql
  - users.yaml
```

For the API schema file Configuration, we will talk more in [API Schema](./api-schema).

### `document-generator` options

- **specs -** The API document used specifications, The document generator will generate the specifications and make our document server run it. The default is [Open API 3.0 specification](https://spec.openapis.org/oas/v3.0.0).

```yaml
document-generator:
  specs:
    - oas3
```

## Extension

You could set the VulcanSQL extension configuration. The [Extensions](../extensions/overview) could let users extend to do powerful things. VulcanSQL also uses the extensions to create built-in extensions which enable it to run the feature.

Below is an configuration sample, these extensions work in **serve phase** to make the API have more restrictions when sending requests.

```yaml
profiles:
  - profile.yaml
rate-limit:
  options:
    interval:
      min: 1
    max: 10000
enforce-https:
  enabled: false
auth:
  enabled: false
response-format:
  enabled: true
  options:
    default: json
    formats:
      - json
      - csv
```

Every built-in extension has its configuration, but you don't need to define all of them manually because we have default configurations for most of them.

For the above configuration, if you are interested, you could see [Data Source Profile](./data-source-profile), [Rate Limit](../api-plugin/rate-limit), Enforce HTTPS, [Response Format](../api-plugin/format), and Access Control first.
