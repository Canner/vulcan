# Project Configurations

After creating a VulcanSQL project by `vulcan init`, you will see a file named `vulcan.yaml` under the root of the project directory.
You can see **VulcanSQL's project configurations** like data source, authentication, API Documentation, etc. in the `vulcan.yaml`.

# The project configuration file

Although we said that the `vulcan.yaml` is the main VulcanSQL project configuration file, but it is not mandatory. 
You could change its file name whatever you like by passing the option. However, `vulcan.yaml` is the default filename when you use commands like `vulcan build`, `vulcan serve`, or `vulcan start`.
Therefore, if you rename `vulcan.yaml` to `hello-world.yaml`, then when you run the above commands, you should add the option `-c` or `--config`:

```bash
$ mv vulcan.yaml hello-world.yaml
$ vulcan start -c ./hello-world.yaml  # set the configuation filename to `hello-world.yaml`
```

# The structure of the project configurations

When you run `vulcan init`, you will see some configurations you have pre-defined, below is a sample of the file content:

```yaml
# The project name, description and version
name: my-first-vulcan-project
description: A starter VulcanSQL project
version: 0.2.0

# The configuration options of core features
template:
  provider: LocalFile
  folderPath: sqls
  codeLoader: InMemory
artifact:
  provider: LocalFile
  serializer: JSON
  filePath: result.json
schema-parser:
  reader: LocalFile
  folderPath: sqls
document-generator:
  specs:
    - oas3
types:
  - RESTFUL

# The configuration options of built-in extensions
profiles:
  - profile.yaml
rate-limit:
  options:
    interval:
      min: 1
    max: 10000
enforce-https:
  enabled: false
auth:
  enabled: false
response-format:
  enabled: true
  options:
    default: json
    formats:
      - json
      - csv

# The external extension modules you would like to use in your VulcanSQL project
extensions:
  duckdb: '@vulcan-sql/extension-driver-duckdb'
```

You will see four major sections in the `vulcan.yaml`, the sections consist of **project information**, **configuration options of core features**, **built-in extensions**, and **external extensions**.

## Project information

In the VulcanSQL project configuration, we will provide a section for you to define the project `name` and a `description` for the project's purpose. The `version` will record based on your API version, you should fill in this value when your API changes by following [`semver`](https://semver.org/) conventions.

```yaml
name: my-first-vulcan-project
description: A starter VulcanSQL project
version: 0.2.0
```

## Configuration options of core features

VulcanSQL has some configuration options related to our core features:

```yaml
template:
  provider: LocalFile
  folderPath: sqls
  codeLoader: InMemory
artifact:
  provider: LocalFile
  serializer: JSON
  filePath: result.json
schema-parser:
  reader: LocalFile
  folderPath: sqls
document-generator:
  specs:
    - oas3
types:
  - RESTFUL
profiles:
  - profile.yaml
```

Actually, the `template`, `artifact`, and `document-generator` options are related to the `vulcan build` and `vulcan serve` commands and we called them **build phase** and **serving phase**. 
The `schema-parser`, `types` and `profiles` are used in the **serving phase**.

### Build phase and Serving phase

In the **build phase**, VulcanSQL will use the `template` options to find where is the user-written SQL files and compile the SQL files to the compiled artifact file according to the `artifact` options.

In the **serving phase**, VulcanSQL will use the `schema-parser` options to find where is the user-written API schema files, then VulcanSQL will check the API protocol user would like to create as the API endpoints, according to the `types` option.

When API is created and users send requests to the API endpoints, VulcanSQL will use the `template` and `artifact` options again for translating the SQL files and send to data sources. VulcanSQL relies on `profiles` options to find each data source connection settings.

### `template` options

- **provider** - The `provider` represents what is the provider used to read the SQL files. VulcanSQL uses the `LocalFile` type as a default value, which means the SQL files are put in local places.
- **codeLoader** - The `codeLoader` option tells the compiler what code loader type we keep the data in, and the default value is `InMemory` .
- **folderPath** - When the `provider` is `LocalFile`, we need to set the `folderPath` option. The `folderPath` indicates a folder location where your SQL files are located at.

```yaml
template:
  provider: LocalFile
  folderPath: path/to/folder
  codeLoader: InMemory
```

If you provide the folder name directly, we will find the folder in the current project.

```yaml
folderPath: sqls # path to ./sqls folder
```

### `artifact` options

- **provider** - Similar to `template` options' `provider`, but it is used to save and read the artifact file. The default value is `LocalFile`.
- **serializer** - It indicates the format the compiled artifact file is serialized to.
- **filePath** - The location to the compiled artifact file.

```yaml
artifact:
  provider: LocalFile
  serializer: JSON
  filePath: path/to/file.json
```

### `schema-parser` options

- **reader** - Similar to `template` options' `provider` The default value is `LocalFile`.
- **folderPath** - When the `provider` is `LocalFile`, we need to set the `folderPath` option. The `folderPath` indicates a folder location where your API schema files are located at.

```yaml
schema-parser:
  reader: LocalFile
  folderPath: sqls # Path to ./sqls folder
```

We suggest you put each API schema file in the same folder as respsective SQL file and have the same name as the respective SQL file.

```yaml
/sqls
  # Query order SQL file and its API schema file
  - orders.sql
  - orders.yaml
  # Query users SQL file and its API schema file
  - ursers.sql
  - users.yaml
```

For the API schema file configurations, we will talk more in [API Schema](./api-schema).

### `document-generator` options

- **specs** - It's the specification used in the API document. 
The document generator will generate the specifications and make our document server run it. 
The default is [Open API 3.0 specification](https://spec.openapis.org/oas/v3.0.0).

```yaml
document-generator:
  specs:
    - oas3
```

## Built-in and External Extensions

You could set the VulcanSQL extension configurations. The [Extensions](../extensions/overview) grant users power to do powerful things. 
VulcanSQL also has some built-in extensions, and you can check out [here](../extensions/overview).

Here is a configuration sample of VulcanSQL's built-in extensions, and these extensions work in the **serving phase** to 
privde the APIs with more restrictions when sending requests.

```yaml
profiles:
  - profile.yaml
rate-limit:
  options:
    interval:
      min: 1
    max: 10000
enforce-https:
  enabled: false
auth:
  enabled: false
response-format:
  enabled: true
  options:
    default: json
    formats:
      - json
      - csv
```

Every built-in extension has its configuration, but you don't need to define all of them manually because we have default configurations for most of them.

For the above configuration, if you are interested, you could see [Data Source Profile](./data-source-profile), [Rate Limit](../api-plugin/rate-limit), Enforce HTTPS, [Response Format](../api-plugin/format), [Authentication](../data-privacy/authn) first.
