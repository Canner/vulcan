# Extensions

Extension is VulcanSQL advanced feature to make users satisfy particular use cases by using our extension components to customize.

We divide extensions into **built-in extensions** and **external extensions** according to different purposes.

The built-in extensions are VulcanSQL built-in function including `profiles`, `rate-limit`, `enforce-https`, `response-format`, and `auth` which are mentioned in [configuration](./api-building/configuration).

The external extensions are used to make users create functions they need to solve their requirement from particular system architecture environment or satisfy use cases.

For example, some enterprises may use AWS Redshift or Azure Synapse be data source to save data, then you could use [DataSource](./extensions/vulcan-sql-core/data-source) extension to implement Redshift or Synapse connector to query data.
